## Machine Learning terms
### Algorithm
- The algorithm is the mathematical or statistical model that learns patterns and relationships from the data. There are various types of machine learning algorithms, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning.

### Model
- The model is the output of the training process, which represents the learned patterns and relationships from the data. The model can be used for making predictions or making decisions on new, unseen data.

### Prediction/Inference
- Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions or infer outcomes for new, unseen data based on the patterns it learned during training.

ML:
Machine learning is applied in a wide range of domains, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, and more.
