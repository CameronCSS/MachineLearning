Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.

## NLP terms and objectives
### Natural Language Understanding (NLU):
- NLP aims to enable computers to understand human language, including the meaning of words, sentences, and documents. This involves tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging.

### Natural Language Generation (NLG): 
- NLP also deals with generating human-like language from structured data or other forms of information. This could involve creating human-readable summaries, responses to queries, or even writing coherent text based on specific input.

### Language Translation:
- NLP is used in machine translation systems to translate text or speech from one language to another. It involves understanding the semantics and grammar of the source language and generating equivalent content in the target language.

### Speech Recognition:
- NLP is employed in speech recognition systems to convert spoken language into written text. This technology is used in voice assistants, transcription services, and other applications where spoken language needs to be processed.
